# SortingMenu-Project

## Goals
 - Generate a data set with 10,000 numbers in it.
 - Use the following five sorts on the data: bubble, insertion, selection, merge, and quick.
 - Determine how long the sort took to complete.
 - Count the iteration in each sort.
 - Output the sorted data along with the time taken to complete and the iterations taken to complete.

## Currently Implemented Goals
 - Generate a data set with 10,000 numbers in it.
 - Sorts:
   - bubble:
     - sort implemented
     - duration measure
     - iteration counter
     - output: data set, duration and, iterations
   - insertion
     - sort implemented
     - duration measure
     - iteration counter
     - output: data set, duration and, iterations
   - selection:
     - ~~sort implemented~~
     - ~~duration measure~~
     - ~~iteration counter~~
     - ~~output: data set, duration and, iterations~~
   - merge:
     - ~~sort implemented~~
     - ~~duration measure~~
     - ~~iteration counter~~
     - ~~output: data set, duration and, iterations~~
   - quick:
     - ~~sort implemented~~
     - ~~duration measure~~
     - ~~iteration counter~~
     - ~~output: data set, duration and, iterations~~
